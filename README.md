# Google Play Music Skill

## Notes:
* At present, this is only a starter skill and can only play one track.
  I'm working with the Mycroft team on an audio service API that will let me
  "double buffer" tracks indefinitely so a station can play until the playlist
  runs out.

## Usage:
* `play <station> on Google Play Music`
